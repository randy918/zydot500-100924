        <div class="column">
            <p class='faq__question'>Do Zydot products really work?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Yes, Zydot products do work! We are fortunate to have many return customers who are
                completely satisfied
                with our entire line of products. Plus, independent double-blind studies as well as our own research and
                development testing gives us the confidence to offer a 100% money back guarantee on all Zydot products
                if you are not completely satisfied with your results.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Are Zydot products safe?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'><span>Zydot Ultimate Blend</span> is made of all natural ingredients and
                are
                FDA approved. <span>Our Ultra Clean Hair Purifying Treatment</span> is formulated to be gentle and safe
                to your hair
                while removing unwanted toxins.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Why do I need to remove toxins?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>No matter how "clean" a life you lead -- healthy eating, exercise, regular stress
                relief -- your body is
                likely to show evidence of accumulated toxicity. A detox can help your body to rid itself of some of
                these
                toxins, naturally, while also giving your body a chance to rest, repair and regroup. Both your liver and
                your kidneys (along with your blood, bowel, lymphatic system and skin) help your body process and
                eliminate
                impurities in your sweat, urine and feces. Detoxing can help to support and enhance this natural
                process.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>When should I begin cleansing?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>The sooner you begin the cleansing process, the better your results and the healthier
                you will be. Toxins
                are impurities or poisons that can lead to all sorts of health problems. You should rid your body of any
                and
                all toxins on a regular basis to ensure proper health.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>How long do toxins remain in my body?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>That depends. Many different factors contribute to how long toxins remain in your
                system including your
                metabolic rate, body condition, type of toxins, frequency and amount of toxins that you come in contact
                with, as well as the amount of water you drink on a daily basis.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>How do I obtain the best results?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>First, do all you can to avoid exposure to any new toxins. Second, drink plenty of
                water. Third, avoid
                alcohol, acidic liquids (vinegar, pickle juice, etc.) salty foods, non-prescribed medications and large
                amounts of vitamins, and drink <span>Ultimate Blend </span>after you
                have
                been awake for 4 to 5 hours.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Why is it so important to follow the instructions?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>The instructions that accompany our products were developed to achieve maximum
                effectiveness. When used
                improperly Zydot products are not allowed to perform the cleansing process as intended, and may lead to
                unsatisfactory results.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Can I take multiple Zydot products at the same time?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Drinking more than one bottle of <span>Zydot Ultimate Blend</span> may not increase effectiveness,
                and if you drink
                too much (more than 32oz) for any specific cleansing period it may be counterproductive. However, we do
                recommend certain combinations of Zydot products that can improve the cleansing process.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Do Zydot products "mask" or cover-up toxins?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>No, Zydot products do not "mask" or cover-up toxins. Zydot products actually cleanse
                or flush your body
                of
                unwanted toxins. Also, our products are made of all natural ingredients that are commonly found in most
                healthy diets and they do not leave behind impurities of their own.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Will the toxins be gone for good?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Your body is constantly releasing toxins into the urinary system as part of its
                natural cleansing
                process.
                Zydot products will cleanse the toxins from the urinary system, however, the toxins will return after a
                4 to
                5 hour period as a result of the body's natural cleansing process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">

            <p class='faq__question'>Are there any negative side effects?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'><span>Zydot Ultimate Blend</span>is a 100% natural
                product. However, as
                with
                any nutritional supplement you may want to consult a physician before consuming.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>I don't think I have any toxins in my system, why should I still use Zydot
                products?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Sadly, the consumption of common everyday foods, prescriptions, and over the counter
                medications can lead
                to
                toxin build up in the system. You may be contaminated with toxins and not even know it. So it is better
                to
                be safe than sorry.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Why is Zydot Ultra Clean Shampoo head and shoulders above the competition?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'><span>Zydot Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment</span> is actually three products in
                one. A <span class = 'cap-red'>SHAMPOO</span>,
                designed
                to wash away external barriers such as hair spray, styling and finishing products, and everyday dirt and
                grime buildup to expose the inner hair. A <span class = 'cap-red'>PURIFIER</span>
            </span>, designed to penetrate the hair shaft's inner
                structure
                to dissolve, release, and remove the chemicals and medications bonded within the hair shaft, leaving
                your
                hair pure, clean and free of all unwanted contaminants and impurities. And a <span class = 'cap-red'>CONDITIONER</span>
            </span> designed to
                control
                tangles, add sheen, and improve manageability. Maybe ours is the best hair purifying treatment on the
                market
                for the simple reason that it works better than any other product out there.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Can I use Zydot Ultra Clean on my body hair?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Yes. <span>Zydot Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment</span> is a full body shampoo,
                purifier, and
                conditioner. If you are cleansing your hair you will want all of your hair cleansed.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>If my hair is very thick or very long will one package be enough?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>For individuals with extremely thick, coarse, curly and/or long hair (6 inches or
                more), two or more
                packs of <span>Ultra Clean Internal Hair Purifying Treatment</span> may be needed. The process works as long as there
                is a total saturation of the hair paying special attention to the hair closest to the scalp. Toxins are
                harder to cleanse from very dark hair or thick and coarse hair.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>How much of my hair stores toxins? How long will toxins stay in my hair?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>The length of time that toxins are stored in hair will depend on the level of toxin
                exposure, the type of
                toxins, your metabolism, and the length of your hair. The amount of hair you should be concerned with is
                the first 1 1/2 inches closest to the scalp (approximately 90 days of growth).</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>What is the difference between the 16oz and the 32oz? How about the liquid or
                powder?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>The <span>Ultimate Blend 16oz</span> is our standard product and is the best Detox drink for most
                people. The <span>Ultimate
                Blend 32oz</span> is designed to accommodate individuals weighing 220 lbs. or more and individuals who may have
                toxin levels exceeding normal levels. The powder product is available in 16 oz. only and is the same
                exact product as the liquid version, minus the water.</p>
            <p class='faq__question'>Why should I purchase Zydot over the competition?</p>
            <p class='faq__answer'>Simply put, because you want peace of mind — knowing that you are getting the best
                Detox products on the
                market. Almost all companies offering Detox products are doing so as a result of our pioneering efforts,
                and are marketing their products as "just like Zydot only cheaper!" Why settle for a cheap knock-off of
                inferior quality.<span> Trust only the First and the Best Detox products on the market.</span></p>
